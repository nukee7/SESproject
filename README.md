This Project is a stock market sentiment analysis and prediction system built with Django, Firebase, and machine learning models like FinBERT, LSTM, and XGBoost. It fetches real-time news and stock data using the Polygon API and Google News API, analyzes the sentiment of news articles, and predicts stock prices by combining historical data, technical indicators, and sentiment scores. The project features a full-stack setup with user authentication, a dashboard to view stock trends, and stores data securely in Firebase.

To run the project, clone the repository, install the required packages listed in requirements.txt, configure your API keys and Firebase credentials, then start the Django server. The system is designed for future deployment on AWS and aims to evolve with more real-time stock updates, improved prediction models, and a possible mobile app extension. This project is intended for educational purposes and showcases a full-stack approach to finance + AI solutions.
