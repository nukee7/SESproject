This Project is a stock market sentiment analysis and prediction system built using Python and Streamlit. It uses the Polygon API to fetch real-time stock data and news articles. Sentiment analysis is performed with the FinBERT model, while stock price prediction is done using a hybrid model combining LSTM and XGBoost. The app provides an interactive dashboard where users can input stock symbols, view sentiment scores, and see future price predictions based on sentiment and technical indicators.
To run the project, clone the repository, install the required packages from requirements.txt, and launch the Streamlit app with streamlit run app.py. This project is designed to demonstrate how machine learning, sentiment analysis, and financial data can be combined into an easy-to-use web application. It is ideal for anyone interested in finance, AI, or real-time data-driven stock market predictions.
